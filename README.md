# rasebpi-plex
cheapest and resource for rase berry pi + plex

My mac is getting old, can't work on it as CPU go up to 100% while family is watching.

The plan is to move the Plex server to Raspberry Pi. It should be a economical replacement for the media function. 

The solution seems mature, references can be found easily. I ordered the new board, prepare the SD card, and format my 4TB external USB drive to ext4 format. As the board arrives, I will get my hand dirty and note the process here.
